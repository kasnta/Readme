###A letter to future Yousif

Comming this far and learning this much was fatful and definite, for us to overcome the hurdles is a must to achieve our dream.
Do what ever it takes, engage in web developing communities (even though you are not that good at it), learn new techniques to help you tackle the problem inhand differntly, also reach out to professionals hosting Udacity programs.
Most importantly, **NEVER GIVE UP !!**

### Goals as a developer

* One of my main goals is to create my own product. 
> One of reasons I took this path (front-end) is the personal satisfaction behind creating content and being able to get creative while creating it.

* Be of great help to orignizations needing my skills as a developer.
* Be part of an orginization's success story.

### My Questions

1. How competitive will I be compared to other entry-level gradutes from other programs?
2. Do I need to pair these courses with external ones to boost my coding knowledge?
3. How difficult will it be to nail my first web developing job? And what extra activities should I do to help me get a job in web developing?
